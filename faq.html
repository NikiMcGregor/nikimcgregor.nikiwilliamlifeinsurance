      <details>
        <summary>What is a death benefit?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          The <em>death benefit</em> is the amount a policy may pay to your beneficiaries if the insured person passes away while the policy is in force, subject to policy terms and claim approval by the carrier.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How does term life insurance work?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          With <em>term life insurance</em>, you choose a term length (e.g., 10–30 years) and a coverage amount. If the insured dies during the term, the beneficiary may receive the death benefit according to the policy provisions.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Is group life insurance through my employer enough?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <em>Group life insurance</em> can be a great start, but amounts are often limited and may not be portable if you change jobs. Many families supplement with an individual policy to lock in coverage that fits long-term goals.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What’s a mutual insurance company?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          A <em>mutual insurance</em> company is owned by policyholders rather than stockholders. That structure can influence dividends and long-term priorities. We can compare mutual and stock carriers to help you decide.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How much life insurance coverage do I need?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          It depends on income, debts, dependents, and future plans. Common starting points are 10–12× annual income or a needs analysis that considers mortgage, childcare, and college costs. We’ll help tailor an amount for your situation.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Will I need a medical exam?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          It varies by product and carrier. Some offer simplified or accelerated underwriting (no exam) for eligible applicants. Final approval and requirements are determined by the issuing life insurance company.
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How do quotes and rates work?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          Online quotes are estimates. Final rates depend on underwriting, health history, lifestyle, and other factors. Product availability and features vary by state and carrier.
