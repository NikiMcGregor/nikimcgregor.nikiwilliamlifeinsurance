      <details>
        <summary>What is a death benefit?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The death benefit is the sum a life insurer may pay to your beneficiaries after a covered person passes away while the policy is active. This payment can help replace income, cover mortgage obligations, fund education costs, and manage everyday household expenses during a difficult time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Payout rules depend on the contract and the carrier’s claims process. We explain how beneficiary designations work, what documentation is usually needed, and how different policy types handle the benefit. Our goal is to help you choose coverage that supports your family’s financial plan.
          </p>

      <details>
        <summary>How does term life insurance work?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            A term policy provides protection for a set period such as ten, twenty, or thirty years. You select a coverage amount and term length that fits your budget and your goals. If the insured person dies during the term, the insurer may pay the death benefit to the beneficiaries named on the policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many families choose term coverage for income replacement while raising children or paying down a mortgage. We help you compare policy terms, riders, and conversion options so you can see how a plan may adapt as your life changes.
          </p>

      <details>
        <summary>Is group life insurance through my employer enough?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Employer group coverage is a useful starting point because enrollment is simple and the cost is often low. The challenge is that limits can be modest and the coverage may end when you change jobs. That is why many people layer an individual policy on top of what they receive at work.
          </p>
          <p>
            We compare your group benefits with individual options so you can see the difference in portability, benefit amounts, and long-term fit. The goal is a combined strategy that protects your household through different stages of life.

      <details>
        <summary>What is a mutual insurance company?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            A mutual insurer is owned by its policyholders. This ownership model can influence how profits are used, such as supporting dividends on certain policy types or reinforcing financial strength. A stock insurer, by contrast, is owned by shareholders and may have different priorities.
          </p>
          <p>
            We work with a range of reputable carriers and explain how each company’s structure, ratings, and product design may matter to you. That way you can choose the partner and policy that align with your preferences.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How much life insurance coverage do I need?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The right amount depends on income, debts, savings, dependents, and future goals. A quick starting point is a multiple of income, often ten to twelve times annual earnings. A more precise approach is a needs analysis that looks at the mortgage, childcare costs, education plans, and long-term living expenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            We walk through scenarios with you and adjust for existing resources so you are not over- or under-insured. The result is a coverage target that feels appropriate and sustainable for your budget.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Will I need a medical exam?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            It depends on the product and the carrier. Some applicants qualify for simplified or accelerated underwriting that relies on health data and may not require a physical exam. Others may be asked to complete an exam so the insurer can fully evaluate the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            We help set expectations before you apply and present options that match your comfort level. Final requirements are determined by the issuing company and are part of its underwriting guidelines.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How do quotes and rates work?</summary>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Initial quotes provide an estimate based on the information available at the time. The final premium is set after underwriting and reflects health, lifestyle, family history, and other factors. Product features and availability vary by carrier and by state.
          </p>
          <p>
            We compare multiple companies so you can see a range of options. Our role is to explain tradeoffs in plain language and help you select a plan that balances cost, benefits, and flexibility.
